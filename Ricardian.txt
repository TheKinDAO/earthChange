earthChange is a [Fungible Token] (coin) limited in **circulating_supply** by the total M² of land held under these terms, and limited in **total_supply** by the total M² of land on Earth(*).

eC does not represent property ownership, conveys no rights of governance, and suggests no expectation of profit.

(*)The land on Earth is currently around 150 Trillion M², but that may increase if land is added (whether floating or secured), so it is suggested total_supply be the entire surface area of planet, which is about 510 Quadrillion M².  This makes "CubeCoin" more obvious as we track all space above and below the surface as tunnels and in the oceans and of course the entire universe.
