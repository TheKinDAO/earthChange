# earthChange
earthChange is a [Fungible Token] (coin) limited in **circulating_supply** by the total M² of land held under these terms, and limited in **total_supply** by the total M² of land on Earth*.

eC does not represent property ownership, conveys no rights of governance, and suggests no expectation of profit.

(*)The land on Earth is currently around 150 Trillion M², but that may increase if land is added (whether floating or secured), so it is suggested total_supply be the entire surface area of planet, which is about 510 Quadrillion M².  This makes "CubeCoin" more obvious as we track all space above and below the surface as tunnels and in the oceans and of course the entire universe.

This implementation is at ft/src/lib.rs based on the NEP-141 example at https://github.com/near-examples/FT

The contract has been deployed as shown at https://explorer.testnet.near.org/transactions/CwXMsRmvNGo5xhBqbBWWbMmpMevzVmkQugEVW6wbP5Nh
